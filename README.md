# Scout

Anime database utilzing a MyAnimeList dataset from Kaggle. On top of functioning as a regular anime database, this project aims to solve pain points of anime viewers such as finding good anime recommendations that tailor to their taste and being able to quickly share their favorite anime with others. 

Scout utilizes an Express and MongoDB back end stack and the source code for that can be found here: [Scout Serverside](https://github.com/wilyyy/scout-serverside)
