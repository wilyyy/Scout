**This project is currently on hold as we are currently tinkering with the codebase to incorporate best practices and create a unified coding standard throughout the application.**

Anime database utilzing a MyAnimeList dataset from Kaggle. On top of functioning as a regular anime database, this project aims to solve pain points of anime viewers such as finding good anime recommendations that tailor to their taste and being able to quickly share their favorite anime with others. 

As the last term project for BCIT's Digital Design & Development program, this project delves into our first venture into the MERN stack.
